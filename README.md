# Two_layer_dambreak
Herein, a MATLAB platform code titled "Two_layer_dambreak" is presented to simulate ideal dam-break problems over a horizontal channel using two-layer shallow water flows with identical density. The governing equations are available through Chen et al. (2007), who extended the classic Stoker's (1957) analytical solution to a two-layer equation system. The figures below demonstrate the initial conditions in addition to the results of the flow depths and velocity.
